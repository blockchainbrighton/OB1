# The OB1 Audional Web3 Sequencing Collection 

User Guide

Welcome to The OB1 Audional Collection, a groundbreaking, innovative, web3 hybrid audio/visual Ordinal collection that leverages the power of Bitcoin ordinals to create a decentralized musical experience. By using audio samples inscribed directly onto the Bitcoin blockchain, each "smart audio sample" becomes a unique, immutable piece of the musical puzzle. With the Ordinals Sequencer, you can harness these samples from the OB1 collection to craft songs in a novel, decentralized fashion across multiple browser tabs.

## Introduction to Ordinals Sequencer

The Ordinals Sequencer is not just another digital audio workstation; it's a method, a way to interact with music that's permanently etched into the blockchain. This guide will show you how to utilize the OB1 collection of audio samples—each representing a distinct musical element like a kick drum or hi-hat—to sequence music across the decentralized expanse of the Bitcoin blockchain.

### Setting Up Your Session

To begin, navigate to the OB1 collection and open individual HTML files for different audio samples. Each file is designed to autonomously set up loops or play once, depending on how you choose to interact with it. These smart audio samples are entirely self-contained and operate independently across separate browser tabs.

### Basic Controls

- **Toggle Audio Playback**: Click on the specified image within any OB1 sample tab to start or stop its playback. This control allows you to initiate or cease the loop of a sample at will.
- **Trigger Sample Once**: Hit the **Spacebar** to play a sample once. This feature is perfect for dropping in one-shot sounds or effects into your composition.

### Advanced Sequencing Controls

#### Tempo Multiplier

- **Double Tempo**: Press `=` (without `Shift` or `Ctrl`) to double the current tempo, speeding up the sequence.
- **Halve Tempo**: Press `-` (without `Shift` or `Ctrl`) to reduce the sequence's speed by half.
- **Reset Multiplier**: Press `0` to reset the tempo multiplier to its original setting, standardizing the tempo across your samples.


#### Adjusting BPM

- **Increase BPM by 1**: Press `Shift` + `+` to fine-tune the tempo, increasing it slightly.
- **Decrease BPM by 1**: Press `Shift` + `_` to lower the BPM in minor increments.
- **Broad Adjustments**: For larger tempo shifts, use `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `=` to increase by 10 BPM, or `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `_` to decrease by 10 BPM.

#### Volume Management

- **Increase Volume**: Press `.` (dot) to smoothly increase the volume of a sample.
- **Decrease Volume**: Press `,` (comma) to gradually decrease the volume, allowing for subtle fades.
- **Mute/Unmute**: Press `m` to toggle the mute setting, instantly silencing or restoring the sample's volume.

### Crafting Your Composition

1. **Launch Samples**: Open each OB1 audio sample in a new tab to start building your song. Each tab acts as a separate track in your decentralized composition.
2. **Control Playback**: Utilize the playback controls to start loops, add one-shot effects, and orchestrate your music in real-time.
3. **Adjust Tempo and Volume**: Employ the advanced sequencing controls to dynamically modify the BPM and volume, shaping the sonic landscape of your composition.

## Conclusion

The OB1 Audional Web3 Sequencing Collection invites you into a new era of music production, where each sample is a piece of the blockchain, and your browser becomes the stage for a decentralized symphony. By following this guide and experimenting with the OB1 collection, you're not just making music; you're pioneering a unique form of artistic expression on the immutable canvas of Bitcoin's blockchain. Explore, create, and let the decentralized beats unfold.
